# Spottz
 Ever spent more time looking for a parking spot than actually shopping? And just when you think you’ve found one… surprise! It’s a tiny car hiding in plain sight. Spottz is a smart solution designed to end the parking hunt. It scans available spots and guides drivers to the closest free one near the entrance — because life’s too short to circle parking lots.
